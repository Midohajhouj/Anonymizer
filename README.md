An advanced, system-wide anonymization tool that combines Tor, VPN, anti-forensics, network hardening, and cutting-edge obfuscation techniques for a seamless, secure online experience.

## üöÄ Features

- **Multi-layered Anonymity**: Chain Tor and VPN for enhanced privacy.
- **Configurable Kill Switch**: Protect your data with adjustable security levels.
- **Pluggable Transport Support**: Use obfs4, meek, or snowflake for traffic obfuscation.
- **Network Namespace Isolation**: Separate traffic by isolating network namespaces.
- **RAM Disk for Ephemeral Storage**: Secure temporary storage that is erased on reboot.
- **MAC Address Spoofing**: Mask your device‚Äôs MAC address for additional privacy.
- **DNS Leak Protection**: Prevent DNS leaks to ensure anonymity.
- **IPv6 Protection**: Automatically blocks IPv6 traffic to avoid exposing real IP.
- **Traffic Obfuscation**: Conceal your traffic to blend with normal data flows.
- **Decoy Traffic Generation**: Generate fake traffic to further obscure your identity.
- **Hardware Anonymization**: Mask or change hardware identifiers (e.g., HDD serial, MAC).
- **Stealth Mode**: Hide kernel modules to remain undetected by adversaries.
- **Automatic Circuit Rotation**: Regularly rotate Tor circuits for improved security.
- **Leak Monitoring**: Continuously monitor for potential data leaks.
- **Qubes OS Integration**: Works seamlessly with Qubes OS for compartmentalized security.
- **Blockchain Identity**: Implement decentralized identity management using blockchain.
